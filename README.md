# Intuition-Project

This is a game project repository. 

The *Intuition Project* ("Project") is developed for physics principles studies. We feature the interaction between players and physical formulas. The framework of this project is followed by the official report of *the College Board AP Physics C Mechanics Exam*. Thanks and Credit to Mr. Xie, who was my math teacher when I was in China, he inspired me to do this game.
